- `Enter`: Activate/edit selected field
- `Esc`: Exit editing mode/close popups
- `‚Üë/‚Üì`: Navigate lists and select options

### Making Requests
1. Select HTTP method using arrow keys

- Esc: Go back/close collection view
- Tab: Switch between list and new button

### History
- Access request history from left navigation
- Up/Down: Browse through history
- Enter: Load selected request
- Esc: Close history view

## Configuration

Configuration file location: `~/.raquet/config.toml`
```toml
# Default timeout in seconds
timeout_seconds = 30
# Maximum response size in bytes (10MB)
max_response_size = 10485760
# Number of requests to keep in history
history_size = 100
# Default URL (optional)
default_url = ""

Default request headers
[default_headers]
Random-Token = "<random uuid token>"
